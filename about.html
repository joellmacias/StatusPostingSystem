        <p><strong>What special features have you done or attempted in creating the website?</strong></p>
        <p>Creating this website I used Bootstrap for the first time which was quite exciting and fun to use. The UI of the website I thought looked quite nice, simple, and aesthetic.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Which part(s) did you have trouble with?</strong></p>
        <p>Had a bit of trouble with the preg_match part of my code for pattern matching. The other was the check date, I got pretty confused on that and was a bit lost direction-wise. Other than that felt pretty straightforward was just a matter of getting to it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What would you like to do better next time?</strong></p>
        <p>I think one thing I would like to do better is go a bit more in-depth on the UI and learn a bit more about PHP to be better prepared for pattern matching or more.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What have you learned along the way? Did you use any references or resources during this project? If so, please include the sources.</strong></p>
        <p>One of the most helpful resources were my previous labs, I felt well set up doing this assignment and looking back at my labs they were incredibly useful. There were some things I didnâ€™t quite know how to do so I took to the internet, W3 schools was quite helpful. The PHP manual for checkdate was good as well and I ended up exploding my string so I could input it into the checkdate function. I used a bit of CHATGPT mostly for troubleshooting and explaining things to me.</p>
